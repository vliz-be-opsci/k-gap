# LDES Consumer Service

This service is a wrapper around the [ldes2sparql](https://github.com/rdf-connect/ldes2sparql) tool that enables harvesting multiple LDES (Linked Data Event Streams) feeds.

## Overview

The LDES consumer service reads a YAML configuration file containing a list of LDES feeds and spawns a separate `ldes2sparql` Docker container instance for each feed. All spawned containers are attached to the same Docker Compose network.

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

The following environment variables can be configured in your `.env` file:

- `LDES_CONFIG_FILE`: Path to the YAML configuration file (default: `/data/ldes-feeds.yaml`)
- `LDES2SPARQL_IMAGE`: Docker image to use for ldes2sparql (default: `brechtvdv/ldes2sparql:latest`)

### LDES Feeds Configuration File

Create a YAML file (e.g., `data/ldes-feeds.yaml`) with the following structure:

```yaml
feeds:
  - name: example-feed-1
    url: http://example.com/ldes-feed-1
    sparql_endpoint: http://graphdb:7200/repositories/kgap/statements
    polling_interval: 60  # seconds (optional, defaults to 60)
    environment:  # optional additional environment variables
      # Add any additional environment variables needed by ldes2sparql here
      # EXAMPLE_VAR: value

  - name: example-feed-2
    url: http://example.com/ldes-feed-2
    sparql_endpoint: http://graphdb:7200/repositories/kgap/statements
    polling_interval: 120
```

#### Required fields:
- `name`: Unique identifier for the feed (used in container naming)
- `url`: URL of the LDES feed
- `sparql_endpoint`: SPARQL endpoint where the data should be ingested

#### Optional fields:
- `polling_interval`: How often to poll the feed in seconds (default: 60). Note: This is converted to milliseconds and passed as `POLLING_FREQUENCY` to the ldes2sparql container.
- `environment`: Additional environment variables to pass to the ldes2sparql container

## Usage

1. Ensure the ldes2sparql Docker image is available:
   ```bash
   docker pull ghcr.io/rdf-connect/ldes2sparql:latest
   ```
   Or build it locally if needed.

2. Copy the example configuration file:
   ```bash
   cp ldes-consumer/ldes-feeds.yaml.example data/ldes-feeds.yaml
   ```

3. Edit `data/ldes-feeds.yaml` with your LDES feeds

4. Start the service using Docker Compose:
   ```bash
   docker compose up ldes-consumer
   ```

## How it Works

1. The service reads the YAML configuration file on startup
2. For each feed in the configuration, it spawns a new Docker container running `ldes2sparql`
3. Each container is named `ldes-consumer-{feed-name}` and attached to the Docker Compose network
4. Containers are labeled with the Docker Compose project name for integration with the stack
4. The service monitors the spawned containers and automatically restarts them if they fail
5. All containers are gracefully stopped when the service is terminated

## Container Naming

Spawned containers follow the naming convention: `ldes-consumer-{feed-name}`

For example, a feed named `marine-observations` will create a container named `ldes-consumer-marine-observations`.

## Network Integration

All spawned ldes2sparql containers are attached to the same Docker network as the main stack (typically `kgap_default`), allowing them to communicate with other services like GraphDB.

## Logging

Logs from the spawner service can be viewed using:
```bash
docker compose logs ldes-consumer
```

Logs from individual ldes2sparql containers can be viewed using:
```bash
docker logs ldes-consumer-{feed-name}
```
